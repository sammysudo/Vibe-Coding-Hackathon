# SmartBiz Tracker 💰  
A simple web app that helps small traders track income and expenses using **voice input**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many small traders don’t track their income or expenses and have no idea if they’re making a profit. Our goal is to help them log transactions easily using voice commands.

## 🧩 Solution
**SmartBiz Tracker** is a lightweight web app where users can:
- Say what they sold or bought (e.g., "I sold 5 bags of rice at $2 each")
- See the transaction summary on screen
- View total income, expense, and profit (future feature)

Built with ❤️ for the [Vibe Coding Hackathon](https://example.com ) under the #1MillionDevs movement.
